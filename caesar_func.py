# The general approach to the Caesar Cipher problem:
# For each letter in our message, look up the index in the alphabet (represented by a string).
# Then, add 13 to that index.
# If the value is greater than or equal to 26, then subtract 26 (to start over at 'a').


def caesar(encoded_message):
    # encoded_message = input("enter the messge here: ")

    # We will use a string that contains the alphabet.
    # This lets us use the `in` operator to see if a character in our message is a letter.
    # Also, we can ask for the `.index` of a letter.
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

    rotate_by = 13 # We're doing ROT 13

    # Create a variable with an empty string that we'll add decoded letters to.
    decoded_message = ""

    # Iterate through the characters in our message.
    for letter in encoded_message:
        # Anything that's not in the alphabet, just pass through to the decoded_message.
        if letter not in alphabet:
            decoded_message = decoded_message + letter
        else:
            # Grab the index in the alphabet.
            index_in_alphabet = alphabet.index(letter)

            # Add 13 (or whatever the amount of rotation is.)
            new_index = index_in_alphabet + rotate_by

            # See if we've exceeded the length of the alphabet.
            if new_index >= len(alphabet):

                # Shift back to the beginning of the alphabet, if necessary.
                new_index = new_index - len(alphabet)
